/*Type I: At most one transaction is allowed

// Given an array prices[] of length N, representing the prices of the stocks on different days, 
// the task is to find the maximum profit possible for buying and selling the stocks on different days 
// using transactions where at most one transaction is allowed.

Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.

Examples:

Input: prices[] = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The lowest price of the stock is on the 2nd day, i.e. price = 1. Starting from the 2nd day, the highest price of the stock is witnessed on the 5th day, i.e. price = 6. 
Therefore, maximum possible profit = 6 â€“ 1 = 5. 

Input: prices[] = {7, 6, 4, 3, 1} 
Output: 0
Explanation: Since the array is in decreasing order, no possible way exists to solve the problem.*/
